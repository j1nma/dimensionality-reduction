## Dimensionality Reduction
This work is experiments with three dimensionality reduction techniques in Python.

### Installation

### Running

Custom hyperparameters in a textfile i.e. _"./configs/config.txt"_.


A _results_ folder will contain a timestamp directory with the latest results.

This work is a experiment with a number of algorithms on several datasets.
The aim is to get a feeling of how well each of these algorithms works, 
and whether there are differences depending on the dataset.

### Datasets
* Iris (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html) 
* Breast Cancer (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic))
